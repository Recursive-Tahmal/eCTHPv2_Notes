This lab focuses on detecting process injection using **memhunter**, **minjector**, and **Process Hacker 2,** alongside identifying suspicious network activity with the **Captain** monitoring script.

## **Solutions**

### **Task 1: Detecting Process Injection**

#### **1. Process Injection with minjector**

1. **Inject a DLL into notepad.exe:**
    
    - Run **Process Hacker 2** as Administrator.
    - Launch `notepad.exe` and note its PID.
    - Open an elevated Command Prompt and execute:
        
        ```bash
        cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\memhunter
        minjector.exe -m 1 -s C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\memhunter\msimplepayload.dll -t <PID_of_notepad_exe>
        ```
        
    - Verify injection in **Process Hacker 2**:
        - Double-click the `notepad.exe` process.
        - Navigate to the "Modules" tab to find the injected DLL.
2. **Detect the Injection using Memhunter:**
    
    - Do not close the injected `notepad.exe` process.
    - Open an elevated Command Prompt and execute:
        
        ```bash
        cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\memhunter
        memhunter.exe -r
        ```
        
    - Wait for 2-3 minutes for Memhunter to identify the injection.

#### **2. Advanced Process Injection Techniques**

- **Reflective DLL Injection:**
    
    - Use the `-m 5` flag with `minjector.exe`.
    - Focus on the "Threads" tab in **Process Hacker 2** to analyze new threads created by the injection.
- **Process Hollowing:**
    
    - Focus on the "General" and "Modules" tabs in **Process Hacker 2** to detect discrepancies in the loaded image and module mappings.

### **Task 2: Hunting Suspicious Network Connections**

#### **1. Set Up Captain Monitoring Script**

1. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator and execute:
    
    ```powershell
    powershell -ep bypass
    cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\Captain
    .\Monitor.ps1
    ```
    
2. Launch a new instance of `notepad.exe`. The monitoring script will log its activity.

#### **2. Perform Reflective DLL Injection**

1. Inject a reflective DLL into `notepad.exe`:
    
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\memhunter
    minjector.exe -m 5 -s C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\memhunter\reflective_dll.x64.dll -t <PID_of_notepad_exe>
    ```
    
2. Confirm the injection:
    - A message box with "Hello from DllMain" should appear (click the Notepad icon on the taskbar if it is hidden).

---

#### **3. Analyze Logs**

1. Navigate to:
    
    ```
    C:\ProgramData\Captain\Reporting
    ```
    
2. Open `events.json` to review logged process injection activities. Look for functions associated with injection targeting `notepad.exe`.

## **Key Tools Used**

- **minjector.exe:** Perform various injection techniques:
    - Standard DLL injection.
    - Reflective DLL injection.
    - Process hollowing.
- **Process Hacker 2:** Detect injected DLLs or threads.
- **memhunter:** Identify injected processes.
- **Captain:** Monitor and log suspicious process activity.
