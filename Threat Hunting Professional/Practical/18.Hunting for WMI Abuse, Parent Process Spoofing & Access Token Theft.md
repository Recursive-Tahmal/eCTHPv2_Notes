### **Task 1: Have malicious WMI commands been executed on the machine?**

1. **Purpose**: Detect malicious WMI activity.
    
2. **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:
    
    - `wmiprsve.exe` spawning `powershell.exe` with obfuscated commands.
    - Environment variable pattern in Event IDs 12 and 13: `\\Environment\\[a-zA-Z0-9]{5}`.
3. **Process**:
    
    - Check processes spawned by `wmiprsve.exe`:
        
        ```powershell
        Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{logname="Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"; id=1} | Where-Object {$_.Properties[20].Value -like "*wmi*"} | fl
        ```
        
    - Correlate with Security Event Logs to identify remote login activity:
        - Look for `Administrator` login from a remote IP (`13.229.91.59`).
        - Check subsequent `powershell.exe` execution.
4. **Findings**:
    
    - `WmiPrvSE.exe` spawned `powershell.exe` to enable **PowerShell Remoting**.
    - Remote IP: `13.229.91.59`.
    - Evidence suggests limited use of WMImplant’s capabilities (only PSRemoting enabled).
5. **Note**: Avoid hunting for multiple indicators simultaneously when data is sparse; focus on one at a time.

### **Task 2: Has Parent Process Spoofing occurred on the machine?**

1. **Purpose**: Detect adversaries abusing Parent Process Spoofing.
    
2. **Indicators**:
    
    - Unusual parent-child process relationships.
    - Remote thread creation between unrelated processes.
3. **Process**:
    
    - Observe Sysmon Process Creation logs:
        - Identify suspicious parent-child processes like `explorer.exe` spawning `mspaint.exe`.
    - Look for remote thread creation events:
        - Confirm `powershell.exe` interacting with `mspaint.exe`.
4. **Findings**:
    
    - `explorer.exe` spawned `mspaint.exe` (appears normal).
    - `powershell.exe` created a **remote thread** in `mspaint.exe`—anomalous interaction suggesting malicious activity.

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Detection Challenges**:
    
    - Robust Sysmon rules and enhanced audit policies are crucial.
    - Focus on single indicators for sparse data environments.
2. **Adversary Tactics**:
    
    - Abuse of native tools like `wmiprsve.exe` and `powershell.exe`.
    - Exploit parent process spoofing to hide malicious behavior.
3. **Defensive Recommendations**:
    
    - Monitor anomalous process behaviors and remote thread creation.
    - Enable advanced logging for WMI, PowerShell, and process activities.
