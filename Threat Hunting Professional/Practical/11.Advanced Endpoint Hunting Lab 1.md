This lab focuses on detecting **AMSI bypasses** and **Parent PID (PPID) spoofing** attacks using detection scripts and observing anomalous behaviors.

## **Solutions**

### **Task 1: Hunt for AMSI Bypasses**

#### **1. Detect AMSI Usage**

1. Open **cmd.exe** as an administrator.
2. Run the AMSI detection executable:
    
    ```bash
    C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\AmsiPatchDetection\AmsiPatchDetection\bin\Debug\AmsiPatchDetection.exe
    ```
    
3. Execute **powershell.exe** and re-run the detection executable:
    - Notice that PowerShell uses AMSI, and the detection reflects this.

---

#### **2. Execute AMSI Bypass Code**

1. Open a PowerShell terminal and run:
    
    ```powershell
    powershell -ep bypass
    cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\AmsiPatchDetection
    .\ASBBypass.ps1
    ```
    
2. Re-run the AMSI detection executable:
    - The detection now identifies an AMSI bypass in the **PowerShell** process.

---

#### **3. Memory Analysis with Process Hacker 2**

1. Launch **Process Hacker 2** as an administrator.
2. Locate `amsi.dll` in the PowerShell process.
    - Observe that its memory section has **Read/Write/Execute (RWX)** permissions, indicating an AMSI bypass.

---

### **Task 2: Hunt for Parent PID (PPID) Spoofing**

#### **1. Detect Baseline PPID Activity**

1. Open **cmd.exe** as an administrator.
2. Run the PPID spoofing detection script:
    
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\ppid-spoofing
    python detect-ppid-spoof.py
    ```
    
3. Observe normal parent-child process relationships.

---

#### **2. Emulate PPID Spoofing Attack**

1. Find the PID of `explorer.exe` using **Task Manager**.
2. Launch **PowerShell** as an administrator and execute:
    
    ```powershell
    powershell -ep bypass
    cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\ppid-spoofing
    import-module .\PPID-Spoof.ps1
    PPID-Spoof -ppid <PID_of_explorer.exe> -spawnTo "C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe" -dllpath C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\memhunter\msimplepayload.dll
    ```
    

---

#### **3. Verify Detection**

1. Re-run the detection script:
    - The spoofed PPID relationship is successfully identified.
2. Observe the spoofed process in **Process Hacker 2** for verification.
