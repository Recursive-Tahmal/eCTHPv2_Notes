### 1. **Creating IOC Rules**

- Use **Mandiant IOC Editor**:
    - Define attributes of the virus (hashes, file names, IPs, domains, etc.).
    - Create XML-based IOC rules.
    - Ensure rules are specific to avoid false positives.

### 2. **Using FireEye Redline**

- Install and run FireEye Redline for host-based investigation.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Launch **Redline**.
        2. Create a **collector** for memory and file system scanning.
        3. Deploy the collector to infected systems.
        4. Analyze results for indicators of compromise.
    - Focus on anomalies like unknown processes, injected memory, or suspicious registry entries.

### 3. **Creating YARA Rules**

- Identify unique characteristics of the virus (e.g., strings, behaviors).
- Write a basic YARA rule:
    
    yara
	```
    rule VirusName {     
    meta:         
	    description = "Detects VirusName"     
	strings:         
		$malicious_string = "unique_string"     
	condition:         
		$malicious_string 
	}
	```
- Test rules against samples to ensure accuracy.

### 4. **Using YaraGen**

- Automate YARA rule generation:
    - Run `yaragen` on the malware sample.
    - Fine-tune the auto-generated rules for specificity.
