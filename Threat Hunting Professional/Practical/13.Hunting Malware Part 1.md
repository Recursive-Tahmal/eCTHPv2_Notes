This lab involves using **Redline** to analyze a saved memory capture (MANS file) and identify malicious processes.

---

## **Task 1: Load Saved MANS File into Redline**

1. Open the file `AnalysisSession1` from the `AnalysisSession1` folder on the desktop.
2. In Redline, select:
    - **"I am Reviewing a Full Live Response or Memory Image"**
    - OR click **Processes** under **Analysis Data**.

---

## **Task 2: Analyze MANS File and Answer Questions**

### **Q1: How many processes are Redlined? What are they?**

- **Answer:** 4 processes:
    - `conhost.exe`
    - `Meterpreter_Payload_Detection.exe`
    - `svchost.exe`
    - `VGAuthService.exe`

---

### **Q2: Why were they Redlined?**

- **conhost.exe**:
    - No executable exists in its process address space (potential rogue thread executing).
- **Meterpreter_Payload_Detection.exe**:
    - Spawned from a command shell (atypical behavior).
- **svchost.exe**:
    - Spawned with unexpected arguments: `-k bthsvcs`.
- **VGAuthService.exe**:
    - 9 DLLs are **not signed or verified**.

---

### **Q3: Do the Redlined processes show signs of injected code?**

- **Answer:** No injected code found under **Sections** for any process.

---

### **Q4: Do the Redlined processes show indicators of suspicious network traffic?**

- **Answer:** No suspicious network activity found under **Ports**.

---

### **Q5: Any other suspicious processes? If so, what are the indicators?**

#### **Suspicious Process: 1sass.exe**

- **Process Name**: Incorrectly named (`1sass` instead of `lsass.exe`).
- **Parent Process**: Incorrect parent (should be `wininit.exe`).
- **Path**: Invalid path (should be `C:\Windows\system32`).
- **Username**: Uses a user account (should be `SYSTEM`).
- **Memory Sections**: Shows **injected memory** (4 entries flagged as Injected).
- **MRI Score**: 57 (indicates suspicious activity).
- **Ports**:
    - Established connection: `172.16.151.140:49162 <> 172.16.151.133:445` (TCP).
    - Closed connection: `172.16.151.140:49159 <> 172.16.151.133:139` (TCP).
- **Timeline**:
    - File executed before `1sass.exe`: `1sass.chm` launched by `hh.exe`.

---

### **Q6: What file most likely kicked off this suspicious binary?**

- **Answer**:
    - File: `1sass.chm`.
    - Execution Path: `"C:\Users\elslabs\Desktop\1sass.chm"`.
    - Executed by: `hh.exe` (`C:\Windows\hh.exe`).

---

## **Summary**

- **Redlined Processes**: 4 (`conhost.exe`, `Meterpreter_Payload_Detection.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `VGAuthService.exe`).
- **Suspicious Activity**: Found in `1sass.exe` (masquerading as `lsass.exe`).
- **Triggering File**: `1sass.chm` executed by `hh.exe`.
