This lab explores the use of **memory forensics** to detect hidden processes, suspicious network connections, process injection, and indicators of compromise in a Windows system memory dump. The analysis relies on **Volatility** plugins to extract actionable insights.

## **Key Skills Developed**

1. **Memory Image Profiling**
    - Identify suitable profiles using `imageinfo` and trial/error.
2. **Hidden Process Detection**
    - Use `psxview` to uncover hidden or anomalous processes.
    - Address false positives from lingering memory structures (e.g., post-reboot artifacts).
3. **Network Forensics**
    - Detect terminated or suspicious network connections using `netscan`.
    - Analyze unusual network behavior (e.g., PowerShell traffic on port 80).
4. **Process Injection Analysis**
    - Identify injected processes with `malfind`.
    - Differentiate between malicious and legitimate injections (e.g., **MsMpEng.exe** or **SearchUI.exe**).
5. **Pattern Recognition in Memory**
    - Search memory using `strings` to locate malicious scripts (e.g., **Invoke-Mimikatz**, Base64-encoded commands).

## **Investigation Workflow**

### **1. Initial Profiling**

```bash
vol.py -f <memory file> imageinfo
```

- Identify potential profiles (e.g., `Win10x64_10586`) for analysis.

---

### **2. Hidden Process Detection**

```bash
vol.py -f <memory file> --profile=<profile> psxview
```

- Detect processes hidden from traditional enumeration methods.
- Cross-verify with legitimate system processes to filter out false positives.

---

### **3. Network Analysis**

```bash
vol.py -f <memory file> --profile=<profile> netscan
```

- Review active and terminated connections.
- Investigate non-standard network activity:
    - PowerShell communicating over HTTP.
    - Unknown processes on suspicious ports.

---

### **4. Process Injection Analysis**

```bash
vol.py -f <memory file> --profile=<profile> malfind
```

- Highlight memory regions with injected code.
- Confirm legitimate cases (e.g., absence of "MZ" headers or expected behavior).

---

### **5. String and Pattern Recognition**

```bash
strings <memory file> | grep -i "Invoke-\|powershell"
```

- Locate indicators of compromise:
    - Malicious scripts (e.g., **Invoke-Mimikatz**).
    - Encoded PowerShell payloads (Base64 or obfuscated commands).
    - Empire stager signatures.

---

## **Key Indicators of Suspicious Activity**

1. Processes making unexpected HTTP/HTTPS connections.
2. Memory regions with injected or modified code.
3. Artifacts of common attack frameworks:
    - **Invoke-Mimikatz**.
    - PowerShell Empire stagers.

---

## **Takeaways**

- Memory forensics provides a detailed view of:
    - Terminated processes and hidden connections.
    - In-memory artifacts of malware or attack frameworks.
- False positives are common; validate findings against system baselines.
- Anti-forensic methods (e.g., overwritten memory regions) demand deeper inspection.
