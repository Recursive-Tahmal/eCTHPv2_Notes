This lab focuses on detecting **Process Doppelganging** attacks and identifying uncommon API calls used during these attacks.

## **Solutions**

### **Task 1: Emulate and Detect Process Doppelganging**

#### **1. Emulate the Attack**

1. Open **PowerShell** as an administrator and execute:
    
    ```powershell
    powershell -ep bypass
    cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools
    import-module .\Start-Eidolon.ps1
    Start-Eidolon -Target .\test.txt -Mimikatz -Verbose
    ```
    
2. Identify the **PID** of the `test.txt` process.

---

#### **2. Detect the Doppelganging Process**

1. Open **cmd.exe** as an administrator and execute:
    
    ```cmd
    cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools
    .\pe-sieve64.exe /pid <PID_of_test_txt_process>
    ```
    
2. A folder named `process_<PID>` will be created in the tools directory.

---

#### **3. Analyze the Dumped File**

1. Open **PE Studio** from the tools directory:
    
    ```cmd
    C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools\pestudio\pestudio.exe
    ```
    
2. Load the dumped file (e.g., `XXXX.test.txt`).
3. Verify the fileâ€™s contents to confirm that the process contains **Mimikatz**.

---

### **Task 2: Detect Uncommon API Calls (CreateTransaction)**

#### **1. Prepare API Monitor**

1. Launch **API Monitor x64**.
2. Search for the `CreateTransaction` API call in the filter and enable monitoring for it.

---

#### **2. Emulate and Monitor the Attack**

1. Terminate all processes started during **Task 1**.
2. Open **PowerShell** as an administrator and execute the following (without clicking "Monitor" when prompted initially):
    
    ```powershell
    powershell -ep bypass
    cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools
    import-module .\Start-Eidolon.ps1
    Start-Eidolon -Target .\test.txt -Mimikatz -Verbose
    ```
    
3. When prompted by **API Monitor**, click **Monitor** to capture the second PowerShell process only.

---

#### **3. Observe API Call Traces**

1. In **API Monitor**, trace the uncommon API call (`CreateTransaction`) used by the **Process Doppelganging** technique.
2. Verify the captured events to confirm successful monitoring.

---

## **Takeaways**

- **Process Doppelganging** can be detected through tools like **PE Sieve** and **PE Studio**, revealing malicious payloads (e.g., **Mimikatz**).
- Uncommon API calls such as `CreateTransaction` can be traced using **API Monitor**, highlighting their usage in advanced attack techniques.
