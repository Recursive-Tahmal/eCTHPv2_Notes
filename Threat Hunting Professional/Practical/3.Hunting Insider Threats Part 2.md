This lab focuses on analyzing network traffic to identify and understand insider threats. Below is a concise summary:

---

### **Key Observations from PCAP #1**

1. **Unusual Ports:**
    
    - Port **6475** was active, used by **BeeBEEP Secure LAN Messenger**.
    - Identified through Google or the DNS tab in **Network Miner**.
2. **Alice and Bob's Communication:**
    
    - Encrypted traffic via BeeBEEP.
    - Alice accessed the **XAMPP dashboard**, but no malicious actions observed.
3. **Previous Indicators:**
    
    - No evidence linking previous rogue devices or credentials misuse.

### **Key Observations from PCAP #2**

1. **Suspicious Device (W0007):**
    
    - **W0007** entered the network with ARP poisoning tactics, impersonating other devices.
    - Performed **RDP sessions** to XAMPP and Domain Controller (DC).
    - Accessed and downloaded critical files like **ntds.dit**.
2. **Links to Previous Rogue1:**
    
    - **MAC address and hostname** changed but retained the **"rogue"** user account.
    - Used **BeeBEEP** to communicate with Alice after Bob logged off.
3. **Credentials and Shares:**
    
    - Authenticated as **webadmin** to access the "Charles" shared folder on DC.
    - Files retrieved: **Active Directory hashes (ntds.dit)** and registry files.
4. **Bob's Behavior:**
    
    - Queried W0007's presence before logging off.

### **Notable Techniques Learned**

- **Wireshark Features:**
    - **Protocol Hierarchy**, **Endpoints**, and **Conversations** for quick filtering.
- **Manual Inspection:**
    - Identified ARP poisoning, file transfers, and authentication details through session analysis.

### **Key Findings**

- **W0007 Actions:**
    - Performed ARP poisoning and file theft.
    - Logged into critical servers, accessed sensitive data.
- **Alice and Bob's Role:**
    - Secure communication via BeeBEEP but no direct malicious activity observed.

This lab highlights the importance of manual inspection, DNS query tracking, and using network forensic tools like Wireshark and Network Miner to detect insider threats.
