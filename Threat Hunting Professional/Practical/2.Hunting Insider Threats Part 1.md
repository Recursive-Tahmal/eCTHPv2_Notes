### Task 1: Suspicious Devices Identified

|**IP Address**|**Notes**|
|---|---|
|**172.16.151.103**|Hostname **rogue1**, not part of the domain, DNS query to **[www.wireshark.org](http://www.wireshark.org/)**.|
|**172.16.151.125**|Strange MAC address **BEEEEFDEEEAD**, unknown NIC vendor, no hostname/OS details, ports 80 & 443 used.|
|**172.16.151.150**|Strange MAC address **DEEEADBEEEEF**, similar details to 172.16.151.125, communicating over ports 80 & 443.|
|**172.16.151.101**|Login page accessed via unencrypted HTTP (port 80).|

### Task 2: Key Observations (PCAP #1)

1. **Rogue1 (172.16.151.103):**
    - Windows-based device, part of the **WORKGROUP** instead of the internal domain.
    - Queried DNS for **[www.wireshark.org**—potential](http://www.wireshark.xn--org%2A%2Apotential-zn9j/) sign of reconnaissance.
2. **172.16.151.125 & 172.16.151.150:**
    - Communicated exclusively with each other via abnormal TCP traffic (ports 80 & 443).
    - No OS/hostname, fake MAC addresses identified.
    - No SSL handshake observed.

### Task 2: Key Observations (PCAP #2)

|**IP Address**|**Notes**|
|---|---|
|**172.16.151.101**|Renamed to **Kali** with Windows reference, indicating a pentesting tool. Used **macchanger** to spoof MAC.|
|**172.16.151.125**|Detected again with a suspicious activity pattern (same as PCAP #1).|
|**172.16.151.150**|Similar activity to 172.16.151.125.|
|**172.16.151.132**|Only two packets recorded, pointing to Kali box's MAC address.|

### Findings:

- **Rogue1 (172.16.151.103):**
    - **Suspected MITM attack**. Likely reconnaissance attempt using Wireshark or similar tools.
    - Queried DNS for **Wireshark** updates.
- **Kali (172.16.151.101):**
    - Host transitioned into the network mid-capture, likely spoofing Charles' machine's MAC address.
    - Likely leveraged ARP poisoning or MAC spoofing tools.
- **172.16.151.125 & 172.16.151.150:**
    - Unusual TCP traffic between these devices. Likely setup for covert communication.

### Next Steps:

1. Investigate ARP poisoning evidence between **Kali (172.16.151.101)** and **Charles' box**.
2. Reset potentially compromised credentials (exposed in plaintext via HTTP).
3. Confirm Kali’s presence as an unauthorized penetration testing tool and trace user actions.
4. Perform deep dive into remaining devices (**172.16.151.125, 172.16.151.150**).
