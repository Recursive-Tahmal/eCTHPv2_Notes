## Overview

This guide outlines threat hunting methodologies using Splunk for detecting potential security incidents. Each section includes a technique, the rationale, and example Splunk queries for investigation.

## 1. **PowerShell Empire Detection**

### Objective

Identify suspicious PowerShell activity, a common vector used by attackers for command execution and persistence.

### Key Indicators

- Scripts loaded into memory.
- Execution of encoded commands.

### Example Query

```spl
index=main source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational"
| search ScriptBlockText="*" 
| stats count by ScriptBlockText, ComputerName
| where count > 5
```

## 2. **FTP Exfiltration**

### Objective

Detect unauthorized FTP traffic that may indicate data exfiltration.

### Key Indicators

- Unusual spikes in FTP traffic.
- Connections to external or untrusted IP addresses.

### Example Query

```spl
index=network sourcetype=netflow protocol=ftp
| stats sum(bytes_transferred) by src_ip, dest_ip
| where sum(bytes_transferred) > 5000000
```

## 3. **DNS Exfiltration**

### Objective

Spot DNS queries that might be used for data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communication.

### Key Indicators

- High volume of DNS queries.
- Querying non-standard domains.

### Example Query

```spl
index=dns sourcetype=dns_logs
| stats count by query, client_ip
| where count > 1000
```

---

## 4. **Adversary Infrastructure Detection**

### Objective

Identify communications with known malicious IPs or domains.

### Key Indicators

- Connections to blacklisted IPs.
- Communication on uncommon ports.

### Example Query

```spl
index=network sourcetype=firewall_logs
| lookup threatlist.csv ip AS dest_ip OUTPUT risk_score
| where risk_score > 80
```

---

## 5. **Lateral Movement via WMI**

### Objective

Detect the use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for lateral movement.

### Key Indicators

- Remote execution commands.
- Unusual activity from admin tools.

### Example Query

```spl
index=main sourcetype=WinEventLog EventCode=4624
| search LogonType=3 AND (ProcessName="wmic.exe" OR CommandLine="*wmic*")
| stats count by AccountName, ComputerName
```

---

## Additional Notes

- **Customization**: Adjust thresholds and fields (e.g., `index`, `source`, `sourcetype`) as per your environment.
- **Automated Alerts**: Convert these queries into alerts for real-time monitoring.
- **Integration**: Use enrichment (e.g., threat intelligence feeds) to enhance detection capabilities.
