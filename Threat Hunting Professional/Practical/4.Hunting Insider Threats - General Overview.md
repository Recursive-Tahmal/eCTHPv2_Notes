### **General Overview: Hunting Insider Threats (Advanced)**

This exercise refines your ability to identify and analyze insider threats through network forensics using tools like **Wireshark** and **Network Miner**. The focus is on understanding how seemingly routine network activity can mask malicious insider behavior, and how to methodically investigate these threats.

### **Key Skills Developed**

1. **Packet Analysis:**
    
    - Use **Network Miner** for a high-level overview of hosts, sessions, and DNS queries.
    - Use **Wireshark** to inspect specific traffic, focusing on:
        - Encrypted communications.
        - Indicators of ARP poisoning or MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks.
        - File transfers and RDP sessions.
2. **Detecting Unusual Behavior:**
    
    - Identify abnormal ports or services (e.g., BeeBEEP on **TCP 6475**).
    - Recognize new, unregistered devices entering the network.
    - Correlate actions like DNS queries, ARP behavior, and communication patterns.
3. **Insider Threat Profiling:**
    
    - Examine legitimate users (e.g., Alice and Bob) for deviations from expected behavior.
    - Monitor for tools like BeeBEEP or unauthorized software used for secure communications.
4. **Critical File Access Tracking:**
    
    - Identify sensitive file transfers (e.g., **ntds.dit** and registry files).
    - Understand credentials misuse (e.g., **webadmin** authentication).

### **Investigation Workflow**

1. **Preliminary Analysis:**
    
    - Load PCAP in **Network Miner** to extract host and session details.
    - Focus on the subnet of interest (e.g., **172.16.151.0/24**).
    - Identify unusual devices, services, or traffic patterns.
2. **Deep Dive with Wireshark:**
    
    - Use **Conversations** and **Endpoints** to locate traffic of interest.
    - Sort by ports or protocols (e.g., **TCP 6475** for BeeBEEP).
    - Follow sessions and streams for encrypted or suspicious activity.
3. **Correlate Findings:**
    
    - Investigate any DNS queries revealing software or external connections.
    - Track file system interactions (e.g., shared folders, sensitive files).
    - Link user actions with device activities.
4. **Identify Threat Indicators:**
    
    - Look for signs of ARP poisoning, MITM attacks, or rogue devices.
    - Verify connections to critical servers (e.g., **XAMPP, DC**).
    - Correlate user accounts with previous incidents (e.g., **rogue1** â†’ **W0007**).

### **Tools & Techniques**

- **Network Miner:**
    - Extract high-level overviews (Hosts, DNS, Sessions).
    - Isolate communications between suspected devices.
- **Wireshark:**
    - Apply filters for ports, IPs, and protocols.
    - Use statistical tools (**Protocol Hierarchy, Conversations**) to focus efforts.
    - Inspect streams for patterns in traffic, authentication, and data exfiltration.

### **Lessons from PCAPs**

- **PCAP 1:**
    - Identify insider communication tools (e.g., BeeBEEP).
    - Track user activities like web access (e.g., XAMPP Dashboard).
- **PCAP 2:**
    - Recognize ARP poisoning and rogue devices (**W0007**).
    - Analyze RDP sessions, file access, and data exfiltration activities.

### **Takeaway**

By integrating insights from tools and correlating user actions with network behavior, you gain practical skills in detecting and mitigating insider threats. The workflow and techniques help prepare for real-world scenarios where attackers exploit legitimate user behavior to mask malicious intent.
