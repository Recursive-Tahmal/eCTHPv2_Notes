### **Task 1: Understand .NET memory-based attacks**

1. **Purpose**: Analyze the use of "Bring Your Own Land" (BYOL) techniques by attackers.
2. **Concept**:
    - **BYOL Definition**: Executing custom .NET assemblies directly in memory, bypassing "Living off the Land" (LotL) detections.
    - Example: CobaltStrike's `execute-assembly` command.

### **Task 2: Detecting in-memory .NET threats**

1. **Purpose**: Hook .NET functions to detect suspicious activity.
2. **Process**:
    - Hook all .NET processes on the system.
    - Inline hook the `LoadImage` function used to load assemblies in memory.

### **Task 3: Tools for .NET threat detection**

1. **Recommended Tool**:
    - [ClrGuard](https://github.com/endgameinc/ClrGuard): Provides .NET hooking capabilities for proactive detection.
2. **Additional Resources**:
    - Elastic Blog: [Hunting Memory .NET Attacks](https://www.elastic.co/blog/hunting-memory-net-attacks)
    - FireEye: [Bring Your Own Land](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/06/bring-your-own-land-novel-red-teaming-technique.html)

### **Key Findings**

1. **Detection Enhancements**:
    - Focus on in-memory execution of .NET assemblies.
    - Monitor for unusual `LoadImage` usage patterns.
2. **Adversarial Techniques**:
    - Custom tools instead of built-in binaries.
    - Evading traditional LotL detection mechanisms.

---

### **Takeaways**

1. **Proactive Defense**:
    - Implement memory-level detections for .NET activities.
    - Enhance logging and monitoring for .NET-based processes.
2. **BYOL Implications**:
    - Shift to attacker-supplied tools necessitates advanced detection strategies.
