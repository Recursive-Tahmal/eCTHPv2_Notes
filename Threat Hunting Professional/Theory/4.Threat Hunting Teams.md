### Types of Cybersecurity Hunting Teams

The composition of cybersecurity hunting teams varies widely based on the organization's size, industry, and need for proactive threat detection. The following types of teams are commonly encountered:

1. **Ad-hoc Hunter:**
   - Typically responsible for multiple roles within the security team.
   - Hunts may occur infrequently and with a clear plan in place for each operation.
   - Found most often in organizations without a dedicated cybersecurity team.

2. **Analyst and Hunter:**
   - Combines analytical skills with hunting activities, enhancing threat detection capabilities.
   - Often found in small or resource-constrained security teams.
   - Hunts may be more focused on specific threats or vulnerabilities.

3. **Dedicated Hunting Team:**
   - Comprises highly skilled professionals dedicated solely to hunting for threats.
   - May be part of a larger security operations center (SOC) or standalone unit.
   - Typically found in large organizations, government agencies, and those with significant resources dedicated to cybersecurity.

Each team type serves its purpose in addressing the unique needs and challenges faced by different types of organizations. The choice of hunting approach depends on factors such as budget, available expertise, and the organization's risk appetite for proactive threat hunting efforts.
