### How the Network Team Detects Suspicious Activity

- Alerts from **appliances** like IDS/IPS signal potential issues.
    
- **Statistical Flow Analysis** and **Full Packet Capture/Analysis** help identify anomalies.
    
    - **Statistical Flow Analysis**:
        - Provides network visibility using graphs and advanced modeling.
        - Identifies anomalies like unusual spikes (e.g., potential data exfiltration).
        - Works with **network baselines** for better detection.
- Alerts can also originate from the **SIEM**, visible to both IT Security and Network Teams.


### TCP/IP & Networking Primer

#### Importance of Networking Knowledge for Threat Hunting:

1. **Understanding TCP/IP and Network Behavior**:
    - Spot deviations from normal protocol behavior.
    - Identify unusual activities like unscheduled data transfers (e.g., FTP at odd hours).
2. **Essential Knowledge for Threat Hunters**:
    - TCP/IP protocol stack, port numbers, and associated applications.
    - Normal application behavior in the network.
    - Packet structure: Header (for protocol interpretation) and Payload (data).

---

#### Key Concepts:

- **Packets**:
    - Broken at the source, reconstructed at the destination.
    - Headers guide communication; payloads carry actual data.
- **Encapsulation**:
    - Each layer of TCP/IP adds a header to the packet.
    - Reverse process at the receiving host.

### [[OSI Model ]]Overview

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model consists of **7 layers**, each with a specific role in network communication. Understanding these layers helps analyze how data travels and where issues might occur.

#### OSI vs. TCP/IP Models:

| **OSI Model** | **TCP/IP Model**  | **Example Protocols**             |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Application   | Application       | FTP, SMTP, DNS, SNMP              |
| Presentation  |                   | NaN                               |
| Session       |                   | NaN                               |
| Transport     | Transport         | TCP, UDP                          |
| Network       | Internet          | IP, ARP, ICMP                     |
| Data Link     | Network Interface | Ethernet, Token Ring, Frame Relay |
| Physical      |                   | NaN                               |

#### Networking Devices:

1. **Routers**:
    - Use IP addresses and routing tables for forwarding packets.
    - Determine best path via routing protocols and metrics.
2. **Switches**:
    - Use MAC addresses and CAM tables for forwarding.

---

#### Protocols to Know:

- **ARP**: Resolves IP to MAC addresses.
- **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented.
- **UDP**: Faster, connectionless.
- **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.

### Common Protocols and Ports

Understanding protocols and their associated ports is essential for monitoring and analyzing network traffic.

|**Protocol**|**Port**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|**SMTP**|25|Used for sending email messages between mail servers.|
|**SSH**|22|Secure Shell for encrypted remote access and file transfer.|
|**POP3**|110|Retrieves email from mail servers; downloads messages to the client.|
|**IMAP**|143|Retrieves email while keeping it stored on the server for multiple device access.|
|**HTTP**|80|Unsecured communication for accessing websites over the web.|
|**HTTPS**|443|Secure communication for accessing websites via encryption (TLS/SSL).|
|**NetBIOS**|137-139|Provides file and printer sharing on Windows networks.|
|**SFTP**|115|Secure File Transfer Protocol for encrypted file transfers.|
|**Telnet**|23|Unsecured protocol for remote communication; replaced by SSH in secure setups.|
|**FTP**|21|Transfers files between client and server without encryption.|
|**RDP**|3389|Remote Desktop Protocol for accessing Windows systems remotely.|
|**MySQL**|3306|Port used by the MySQL database for queries and database management.|
|**MS SQL Server**|1433|Port used for Microsoft SQL Server database communication.|

---

#### Why This is Important:

- **Threat Hunting**:
    
    - Unusual traffic on a well-known port could indicate malicious activity (e.g., SSH brute force or data exfiltration over HTTP).
    - Monitoring these ports can help detect unauthorized access or protocol misuse.
- **Practical Analysis**:
    
    - Match traffic on specific ports to expected protocols.
    - Detect deviations (e.g., FTP traffic over non-standard ports).

Being familiar with these protocols and ports helps identify anomalies and assess potential threats efficiently.

### Packet Analysis & Tools

#### **Tools for Packet Analysis**:

|**Tool**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Libpcap/WinPcap**|Packet capture libraries for Unix (Libpcap) and Windows (WinPcap); used by many tools.|
|**Wireshark**|GUI-based tool for deep packet analysis and protocol inspection.|
|**tcpdump**|Command-line tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic.|
|**Berkley Packet Filter (BPF)**|Filtering system for specifying which packets to capture or analyze.|

---

#### **Port Mirroring**:

- **What is it?**
    
    - Replicates traffic from one or more ports to a mirrored port for analysis.
    - In Cisco switches, this is known as the **SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer)** port.
- **Why is it necessary?**
    
    - Switches send traffic point-to-point, even on the same segment. Without a mirrored port, traffic is not visible for analysis.

---

#### **Configuring Port Mirroring**:

- Typically handled by the **Network Team** or **Network Administrator**.
- If the Threat Hunter has admin access, they can configure mirroring based on switch capabilities.

---

#### **Alternative Methods for Packet Sniffing** (if port mirroring is unavailable):

1. **Network Tap**: Hardware device placed directly on the network link to capture traffic.
2. **MAC Flooding** _(Red Team tactic)_: Overload a switchâ€™s MAC table to force it into hub mode, exposing all traffic.
3. **ARP Spoofing** _(Red Team tactic)_: Manipulate ARP requests to intercept traffic between devices.
