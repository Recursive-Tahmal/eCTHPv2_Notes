### What is a Risk Assessment?

A **risk assessment** is the process of evaluating threats, vulnerabilities, and their likelihood of affecting an organizationâ€™s assets. It identifies critical systems, evaluates the potential impact of incidents, and helps prioritize mitigation efforts.

For more details, see [[Risk Assessment Process]].

### Additional Context:
Other documents, such as a **threat assessment report** or a **business impact analysis (BIA) report**, can further assist in determining which systems or processes require more focus during the risk assessment process. These documents provide valuable insights into organizational priorities and potential impacts.
