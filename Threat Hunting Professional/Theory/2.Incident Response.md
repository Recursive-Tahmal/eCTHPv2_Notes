### Definition

A structured approach for identifying, managing, and resolving cybersecurity incidents to minimize damage and restore operations.

**According to NIST:**  
An incident, or a computer security incident, is defined as a violation or imminent threat of violation of:
1. **Computer security policies.**
2. **Acceptable use policies.**
3. **Standard security practices.**

#### Examples:

### Goal
- Contain, mitigate, and recover from cybersecurity incidents.
- Reduce impact on operations and safeguard assets.

### Process
- **[[Preparation]]:**
    - Establish policies, tools, and training for incident handling.
- **[[Detection and Analysis]]:**
    - Detect and confirm incidents through monitoring and alerts.
    - Analyze symptoms to determine if the situation qualifies as an incident.
- **[[Containment, Eradication, and Recovery]]:**
    - Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
    - Remove threats from the environment.
    - Restore operations and validate system integrity.
- **[[Post-Incident Activity]]:**
    - Conduct a post-mortem analysis.
    - Document lessons learned to improve future incident responses.
