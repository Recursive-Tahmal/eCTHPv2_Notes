### Cybersecurity Concepts

#### **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**

- APT: Skilled, organized adversaries (often nation-state-backed) that operate undetected to achieve long-term objectives.
- **Examples:** APT29 (Cozy Bear), APT1 (Comment Crew).

---

#### **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP)**

- **Tactics:** Attack goals (e.g., persistence, exfiltration).
- **Techniques:** Methods (e.g., spear-phishing, DLL injection).
- **Procedures:** Steps (e.g., PowerShell scripts for lateral movement).
- **Examples:**
    - Tactics: Initial Access, Privilege Escalation.
    - Techniques: Phishing, Token Impersonation.

---

#### **Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**

- Forensic data indicating a compromise (e.g., file hashes, IPs, domains).
- **APT1 IOC Examples:**
    - Domain: `uglygorilla.3322.org`.
    - Malware Hash: `5f07a847ab861a2a8e8b0f5e2c203c9d`.

#### **[[Pyramid of Pain]]**

- Concept by David Bianco showing how disrupting IOCs increases difficulty for attackers.

---

#### **[[Diamond Model]]**

- Framework analyzing intrusions via four components: **Adversary**, **Infrastructure**, **Victim**, **Capability**.

---

#### **[[Threat Intelligence]]**

- Data on threats (e.g., IPs, hashes) from sources like open-source, reports, or social media.
- Threats include APTs, cybercrime groups, hacktivists, etc.

---

#### **[[Threat Sharing and Exchanges]]**

- Collaboration between organizations and agencies to share threat data for improved cybersecurity.
- **Example Platform:**
    - **MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform):** Open-source tool for sharing IOCs and malware analysis.

#### **[[Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)]]**

- Specific data identifying cyberattacks, like malicious IPs, DNS queries, or unusual file hashes.
