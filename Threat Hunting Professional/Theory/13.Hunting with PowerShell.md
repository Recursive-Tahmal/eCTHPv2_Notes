- **Components**:
    - **Core Script**: Facilitates execution.
    - **Collector Modules**: Gather specific data.
    - **Analysis Scripts**: Perform frequency analysis on collected data.
- **Requirement**: Requires **LogParser** for analysis.
- **Key Features**:
    - Extracts autoruns and highlights those containing "ps1".
    - Modular design ensures flexibility for enterprise use.

#### **PSHunt**

- **Overview**: PowerShell threat hunting module for scanning remote endpoints for IOCs or gathering system state information.
- **Modules**:
    - **Scanners**
    - **Survey**
    - **Discovery**
    - **Utilities**
    - **Analysis**
- **Capabilities**: Scans for active processes, autostarts, configurations, and logs.
- **Key Resource**: Presented at **BSidesLV 2016**.

#### **NOAH (No Agent Hunting)**

- **Overview**: Agentless, open-source incident response framework based on PowerShell.
- **Use Case**: Collects artifacts quickly without deploying agents, saving time during investigations.
- **Introduction**: Revealed at **Black Hat USA 2017**.
- **Key Benefit**: Enables rapid investigation in enterprise environments without endpoint installations.

### **5.3 Windows Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)**

#### **Overview**

- Agentless threat protection integrated into the operating system.
- Provides preventative measures, attack detection, and centralized security management.
- Adaptive to changing threats with built-in remediation capabilities.

#### **Core Features**

- **Threat Protection Tools**:
    - Windows Defender System Guard
    - Windows Defender Application Guard
    - Windows Defender Exploit Guard
    - Windows Defender Antivirus
    - Windows Defender Application Control

#### **Threat Hunting with ATP**

- Searches 6 months of historical endpoint data instantly.
- **ATP Dashboard**:
    - Displays detected threats with severity ratings, types (e.g., credential stealing), affected machines, and timestamps.
    - Provides alerts, descriptions, and visual process trees to investigate suspicious activities.

#### **Example Use Case: Detecting Mimikatz**

- Alerts for files like `Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1` or renamed scripts (e.g., `Invoke-MMK.ps1`).
- Provides file hashes, disk locations, and associated processes.
- Detects persistence mechanisms (e.g., Registry Run keys) and process injections.

#### **Incident Graph**

- Displays malicious activities visually:
    - Parent-child relationships between processes.
    - Outbound connections (e.g., port 80 for suspicious JPG files).
    - Persistence abuse of registry keys.

#### **Integration with VirusTotal**

- File hashes are submitted to VirusTotal.
- Shows global infection data for specific files.

### **5.4 Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA)**

- **To be explored further (if applicable).**

---

### **5.5 PowerShell Defenses**

- Techniques for mitigating misuse of PowerShell in enterprise environments:
    - Whitelisting trusted scripts and enforcing strict execution policies.
    - Monitoring and logging PowerShell activities for anomalies.
    - Employing tools like **Sysmon** for enhanced event logging.

---

### **5.4 Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics**

#### **5.4.1 Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA)**

- **Purpose**: Provides a real-time view of attack timelines to reduce risk and simplify security insights.
- **Key Features**:
    - Learns and analyzes **normal vs. suspicious user/device behavior**.
    - Self-learning capabilities eliminate the need for manual rule creation or report tuning.
    - Monitors network traffic, events, and contextual entity data (e.g., directory group memberships, titles, managers).
    - Detects abnormal behaviors and known attack techniques (e.g., advanced threats or insider attacks).
    - Integrates with existing **SIEM solutions** and automatically receives updates for new detections.

#### **Example Detections**

- Known malicious techniques like **Pass-the-Hash** or **Pass-the-Ticket**.
- Abnormal behaviors based on learned patterns.

#### **Key Benefits**:

- No approval process required for testing.
- Easily integrates into enterprise environments.
- Additional resources:
    - [ATA Information and Examples](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/advanced-threat-analytics).

---

#### **5.4.2 Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP)**

- **Overview**: A cloud-ready variation of ATA tailored for hybrid Azure environments.
- **Features**:
    - Offers configuration and alerts directly through **Azure Portal**.
    - Advanced detection playbooks (e.g., **Lateral Movement** scenarios such as Pass-the-Hash).
- **Resources**:
    - Comprehensive documentation includes videos, investigative use cases, and playbooks.
    - Example: [Lateral Movement Detection Playbook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-advanced-threat-protection).

### **5.5 PowerShell Defenses**

#### **5.5.1 System-Wide Transcript Files**

- **Purpose**: Captures and centralizes all PowerShell activity in a **network share transcript file**.
- **Use Case**: Provides the Blue Team with a full log of PowerShell commands and outputs per computer/user.
- **Key Benefit**: Enables over-the-shoulder transcript monitoring for increased visibility into PowerShell usage.

---

#### **5.5.2 Constrained Language Mode**

- **Overview**: Limits PowerShell to basic functionality by restricting access to advanced features like:
    - **.NET**, **COM**, or **Win32 API** calls.
- **Enforcement**:
    - Triggered by **PowerShell v5** with **AppLocker Script rules** in enforce mode.
    - Enabled automatically when **Device Guard with UMCI** is deployed.
- **Result**: Prevents advanced malicious actions through PowerShell while allowing basic usage.

---

#### **5.5.3 Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI)**

- **Overview**: Built into **Windows 10**, AMSI scans PowerShell or VBScript code before execution.
- **How It Works**:
    - Sends the code to an anti-malware solution for analysis.
    - Execution is blocked if flagged as malicious.
- **Vendor Support**:
    - Supported by **Microsoft**, **ESET**, and **AVG**.
- **Key Benefit**: Detects and prevents malicious PowerShell code execution, even if run from memory or scripts.
