## **4.1 Introduction**

- Historically, event logs in Windows XP were rarely referenced, used mainly for troubleshooting hardware or software issues.
- The rise of **incident response** highlighted the importance of event logs as a valuable source for determining system actions.
- Event logs have become critical for threat hunters to uncover attack signatures and monitor endpoint activities.

---

## **4.2 Windows Event Logs**

#### **Overview**

- Built-in feature of all Windows versions to audit and monitor system and application events.
- **Core Event Logs**:
    - **Application**: Logs application-related errors, security tool events (e.g., antivirus reports).
    - **System**: Logs system component events (e.g., drivers, services).
    - **Security**: Logs authentication and security processes (e.g., logon attempts, user privilege changes).

---

#### **Event Log Locations**

- **Legacy Systems (Windows XP, 2003):**
    
    - Application: `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\Config\AppEvent.evt`
    - System: `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\Config\SysEvent.evt`
    - Security: `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\Config\SecEvent.evt`
- **Modern Systems (Windows Vista and newer):**
    
    - Application: `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\Winevt\Logs\Application.evtx`
    - System: `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\Winevt\Logs\System.evtx`
    - Security: `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\Winevt\Logs\Security.evtx`

#### **Additional Logs**

- **Setup Logs**: Application setup events.
- **Forwarded Events**: Logs from remote computers.
- **Applications and Services Logs**: Logs from individual applications or system components (e.g., UAC, Sysmon, PowerShell).

---

#### **Importance of Event Logs**

- Monitor:
    - Successful/failed logons.
    - Service creation, starts, or stops.
    - Application usage.
    - Audit policy changes.
    - Changes to user permissions.
    - Events from applications like antivirus.

---

#### **Accessing Event Logs**

- Via **Event Viewer**:
    - Directly open `.evtx` files.
    - Run `eventvwr` in the Search box.
    - Navigate to **Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Event Viewer**.

---

#### **Event IDs**

- Event IDs (EIDs) are unique identifiers for specific actions/events in logs.
- Microsoft documentation provides detailed insights for each EID.
- Note: Event IDs may differ across Windows versions.
    - Example: Network logon:
        - Windows XP: EID **540**.
        - Windows 7 and newer: EID **4624**.

---

## **4.4 Windows Event Forwarding**

Event logs are valuable only when they are accessible.

- **Recommendation**: Forward logs to a **central server** immediately to ensure availability and reduce risks.
- **Action Items**:
    - Enable **Windows Event Forwarding** (WEF) in your environment if it is not already enabled.
    - Refer to [Microsoft's guide on Windows Event Forwarding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-event-forwarding).

---

## **4.5 Windows Log Rotation & Cleaning**

### Risks:

- **Log Clearing**: Logs can be cleared by attackers with administrative rights.
    
    - Event IDs to hunt for:
        - **1102**: Audit log was cleared.
        - **104**: Other log clearing events.
- **Log Rotation**: Without forwarding, attackers can flood endpoints with events to rotate logs and hide traces.

### Considerations:

- Event logs are extremely difficult to tamper with (modification is near-impossible).
- Forward logs to a **central server** to ensure availability and reduce the risk of logs being cleared or rotated.

### Log Retention:

- Define a retention period based on organizational needs:
    - **1 week**
    - **1 month**

## **4.7 Advanced Hunting**

### **4.7.1 LOLBAS**

- **Description**:
    
    - **Living off the land binaries and scripts (LOLBAS)** are Microsoft-signed, native OS files (or downloadable from Microsoft) that attackers use for malicious purposes.
    - Commonly abused to evade detection and bypass whitelisting solutions.
    - Blends in with normal activity, making detection difficult.
- **Functionalities of LOLBAS**:
    
    - Execution
    - Download
    - Copy
- **Examples of Abuse**:
    
    - **`certutil.exe`**: Encode/decode files.
    - **`csc.exe`**: Compile C# code.
    - **`print.exe`**: Remote copy files.
    - **`msbuild.exe`**: Run C# code.
- **Detection**:
    
    - Best sources of information:
        - Event ID **4688** (Process Execution, Advanced Auditing).
        - Sysmon Event ID **1** (Process Creation).
    - Avoid relying solely on filenames (can be renamed/copied).
    - Use **file descriptions** and **parent process ID** for better detection.
- **Key Detection Tips**:
    
    - Filter logs to reduce volume based on:
        - Command-line arguments.
        - Quick execution of suspicious commands.

### **4.7.2 Unmanaged PowerShell**

- **Description**:
    
    - PowerShell abuse is a significant threat due to its legitimate status and ability to run malicious code in memory.
    - Attackers often use PowerShell for:
        - **Bypassing restrictions and whitelisting.**
        - **Avoiding detection with obfuscation techniques.**
- **Enhancements in PowerShell v5**:
    
    - Constrained language mode.
    - Integration with AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface).
    - **Enhanced Logging**:
        - Script block logging.
        - Module logging.
        - Transcription.
- **Event Logs**:
    
    - Located under:

- **Hunting Tips**:
    
    - Focus on:
        - Non-standard host applications using `System.Management.Automation.dll`.
        - Engine versions lower than the PowerShell version installed on the host.
    - Monitor obfuscated commands:
        - Use techniques like stripping obfuscation characters for detection.
- **Unmanaged PowerShell**:
    
    - Attackers may use other applications (e.g., **Ben Ten’s Not PowerShell Project**) to execute PowerShell commands, bypassing detection of `powershell.exe`.
    - Look for:
        - Usage of `System.Management.Automation.dll` by processes other than `powershell.exe` or `powershell_ise.exe`.
- **Key Resources**:
    
    - FireEye’s whitepaper on PowerShell abuse.
    - Tom Ueltschi’s BotConf 2018 presentation.
    - Sean Metcalf’s "Active Directory Threat Hunting" (Bsides Charm 2017).

## **4.7.3 Malicious .NET and LDAP**

### **Malicious .NET**

- **Shift from PowerShell to .NET**:
    
    - PowerShell monitoring by defenders and EDR solutions (e.g., PowerShell logging, AMSI) has pushed attackers to use .NET for tools and techniques.
    - Tools like **Cobalt Strike** use `.NET` through the "execute-assembly" module.
- **Popular Tools in C#**:
    
    - **GhostPack** repository (e.g., **Rubeus**, **SharpHound**, **SharpView**).
- **Challenges in Detection**:
    
    - Uses **reflective injection**; no artifacts are stored on disk.
    - Memory regions are cleared post-execution, leaving minimal traces.
- **Detection Techniques**:
    
    - Use **Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)** for kernel and application-level events:
        - Provider: `Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime`.
        - Tools: **SilkETW** or **SilkService** for simplified configuration and YARA-based filtering.
    - YARA Rules Example:
        - Detect specific strings or methods (e.g., `DuplicateToken` for **Rubeus**).
        - Note: Weak if attackers recompile tools with modified identifiers.
- **Example Detection Workflow**:
    
    1. Execute a tool (e.g., **Rubeus** using `klist`).
    2. Observe generated events (~100-200 per execution).
    3. Focus on specific methods or patterns to reduce noise.

---

### **Malicious LDAP**

- **Description**:
    
    - Attackers use tools like **SharpHound** or **PowerView** to query Active Directory over LDAP.
- **Detection Techniques**:
    
    - Use ETW provider: `Microsoft-Windows-LDAP-Client`.
    - Log large volumes of LDAP activity, including queried users/groups.
- **Example Workflow**:
    
    1. Enable `Microsoft-Windows-LDAP-Client` logging.
    2. Monitor for large spikes in LDAP queries generated by tools like **SharpHound**.
    3. Identify specific users/groups in the logs.

---

## **4.7.4 AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface)**

- **Overview**:
    
    - AMSI integrates with various Windows components (e.g., **PowerShell**, **Office VBA macros**) to analyze in-memory buffers for de-obfuscated scripts.
    - Makes execution of obfuscated/malicious scripts significantly harder.
- **Integration Points**:
    
    - PowerShell
    - Windows Script Host 
    - JavaScript/VBScript
    - Office VBA macros
    - User Account Control (UAC)
- **AMSI Bypasses**:
    
    - Common techniques:
        1. **Unloading AMSI from the process**.
        2. **Patching AMSI in memory**.
- **Examples**:
    
    - **PowerShell AMSI Bypass (Matt Graeber)**:
        
        ```powershell
        [Delegate]::CreateDelegate(("Func" ... )).Invoke('amsiInitFailed', ... ).SetValue($null,$True)
        ```
        
        - Generates **Event ID 4104** with "amsi" in the log (suspicious indicator).
    - **In-Memory AMSI Patching**:
        
        - PoCs modify AMSI directly in memory.
        - Detection:
            - **Wee-Jing Chung's Tool**:
                - Continuously monitors executable code sections for integrity.
                - Alerts on tampering (e.g., `AmsiBypass detected in process ID 34076`).

---

### **4.7.5 COM Hijacking**

- **Overview**:
    
    - The **Component Object Model (COM)** allows Windows applications to interact via the operating system.
    - **COM Hijacking** leverages registry modifications to replace legitimate software with malicious code.
    - MITRE ATT&CK technique **T1122** describes COM Hijacking for persistence and defense evasion.
- **Key Concepts**:
    
    - **COM Classes**: Registered with the OS and mapped to GUIDs (**Class Identifiers/CLSIDs**).
    - Registry locations of CLSIDs:
        - **HKLM**: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\CLSID`
        - **HKCU**: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID`
    - Key registry entries to monitor:
        1. **LocalServer32**: Path to the executable.
        2. **InprocServer32**: Path to the DLL.

---

- **How COM Hijacking Works**:
    - **CLSID Precedence**:
        - CLSIDs in **HKCU** take precedence over those in **HKLM**.
        - Example: A task running a COM object defined in HKLM can be hijacked if a CLSID with the same value exists in HKCU, pointing to a malicious binary.
    - **Privilege Levels**:
        - **Non-privileged users**:
            - Can add CLSIDs in HKCU to hijack execution but cannot modify files/entries in HKLM.
        - **Privileged users**:
            - Can modify **LocalServer32/InprocServer32** in HKLM or replace binary files directly on disk.

---

- **Detection Techniques**:
    - Monitor **registry additions/modifications** to `LocalServer32` or `InprocServer32`.
    - Detect suspicious CLSIDs in **HKCU**, especially if they mirror entries in HKLM.
    - Without baselines, focus on anomalous presence of COM objects in **HKCU**.

---

- **Examples**:
    - **COM Hijacking with rundll32.exe**:
        - COM objects can be executed using **rundll32.exe**, making it a potential vector for abuse.
        - Detection requires monitoring rundll32 activity and associated registry changes.

---

## **Module Conclusion**:
- Recap of important concepts:
        1. Event logs and their importance in detection.
        2. Key logs for monitoring advanced techniques like COM Hijacking.
        3. Role of SIEM tools in consolidating and analyzing log data.
