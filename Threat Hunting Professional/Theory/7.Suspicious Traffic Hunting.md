### ARP Traffic

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** maps IP to MAC addresses and operates via:

1. **Request (Opcode 1)**: Device asks for a MAC address.
2. **Reply (Opcode 2)**: Device responds with its MAC.

---

#### Normal ARP Traffic

- Regular ARP broadcasts from clients, servers, and devices.
- ARP Requests followed by Responses.
- Legitimate **Gratuitous ARP** packets for network updates.

#### Suspicious ARP Traffic

- Large volumes of ARP broadcasts in a short time (e.g., scans).
- Duplicate MAC addresses linked to different IPs.
- Unsolicited **Gratuitous ARP Replies** from attackers (used in ARP Poisoning).

---

#### Threat

- **ARP Poisoning** manipulates ARP cache with fake MAC-IP mappings, enabling Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

### ICMP Traffic

**ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** is used for network diagnostics and troubleshooting, primarily via tools like **ping** and **tracert**.

1. **Echo Request (Type 8, Code 0)**: Sent to request a response from another node.
2. **Echo Reply (Type 0, Code 0)**: Responds to an Echo Request.

---

#### Normal ICMP Traffic

- Regular **ping** requests and replies for diagnostics.
- Typical ICMP packet sizes and types.

#### Suspicious ICMP Traffic

- **Large ICMP packets** (potential covert or exfiltration channels).
- Unusual ICMP **types or codes** (e.g., Timestamp requests followed by abnormal responses).

---

#### Threat

ICMP can be exploited for covert communication or data exfiltration through manipulated packet payloads.

### TCP Traffic

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** ensures reliable data delivery between nodes, using packet sequencing and error recovery. Connections start with a **3-way handshake**:

1. **SYN**: Client initiates.
2. **SYN/ACK**: Server responds.
3. **ACK**: Client confirms.

---

#### Normal Behavior

- Proper 3-way handshake.
- Consistent packet flow without resets.

#### Suspicious Behavior

- Excessive SYN packets (scanning).
- Unusual TCP flags (e.g., FIN+URG).
- Single host scanning multiple ports or nodes.
- SYN → SYN/ACK → RST sequences (port scans).

---

#### Wireshark Tip

Wireshark highlights **relative sequence numbers** for clarity, simplifying packet analysis.

### DHCP Traffic

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** simplifies network management by assigning IP addresses and other configurations dynamically.

---

#### Key Features

- Automatically assigns **IP addresses** and configuration info (e.g., DNS, gateway).
- Uses **UDP Ports 67 (server)** and **68 (client)**.
- Follows the **DORA process**:
  1. **Discover**: Client broadcasts a request for an IP.
  2. **Offer**: DHCP server offers an IP.
  3. **Request**: Client requests the offered IP.
  4. **Acknowledgment**: DHCP server confirms.

---

#### Normal Behavior

- Proper DORA sequence with valid ports.
- Server provides expected configurations like subnet mask, lease time, etc.

#### Suspicious Behavior

- **Rogue DHCP servers** issuing IPs (may enable man-in-the-middle attacks).
- Multiple DHCP Offers or unusual IP ranges.

---

#### Wireshark Note

In Wireshark, DHCP traffic is still labeled under the legacy protocol name **BOOTP**.

### DNS Traffic

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses.

---

#### Normal DNS Traffic

- **Protocol**: UDP on port **53**.
- **Destination**: DNS queries should only go to **DNS servers**.
- **Pattern**: Query followed by Response.
- **Transaction ID**: Should match between query and response packets.

#### Suspicious DNS Traffic

- **Protocol**: TCP on port **53** (should only be UDP unless the response is too large).
- **Destination**: DNS traffic not going to DNS servers.
- **Pattern**: DNS queries with no responses or vice versa.
- **Zone Transfers (AXFR)**: Suspicious if not expected.

---

#### Threats

- **DNS Zone Transfers (AXFR)**: Can reveal internal DNS data.
- **DNS Tunneling**: Used for covert data exfiltration.
- **TCP/53**: Unusual use of TCP for DNS queries, indicating potential misuse or malicious activity.

### HTTP Traffic

#### Normal HTTP Traffic

- **Ports**: Port 80 (TCP), alternate ports 8080/8088.
- **Traffic Type**: Plaintext, uses **FQDN** for web servers.
- **Request-Response**: HTTP requests (GET, POST) and responses (3-digit status codes like 200 OK).
- **Packet Flow**: TCP handshake followed by HTTP communication.
- **Analysis Tools**: Wireshark’s **Follow TCP Stream**, **Protocol Hierarchy**, **Export HTTP Objects**.

#### Suspicious HTTP Traffic

- **IP Access**: Traffic targeting IPs instead of FQDNs.
- **Sensitive Data**: Cleartext credentials or sensitive information over HTTP.
- **Malicious Activity**: Use of SQLi payloads, tools like `sqlmap` visible in **User-Agent** headers.
- **Examples**:
  - Requests like `newsdetails.php?id=26%27` indicate **SQLi attempts**.
  - Repeated malformed queries or automated tool patterns.

---

#### Key Detection Tips

1. Inspect **User-Agent** for signs of automated tools.
2. Analyze request/response patterns for anomalies (e.g., SQL errors).
3. Use Wireshark to isolate TCP streams and extract HTTP objects for deeper inspection.

### HTTPS Traffic

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** ensures secure communication using SSL/TLS encryption.

---

#### Key Points

1. **Handshake**: Involves Client Hello, Server Hello, and key exchange to establish secure communication.
2. **Normal Traffic**:
   - Ports: 443 (TCP), 8443 (TCP).
   - Encrypted data, FQDN-based server destinations.
3. **Suspicious Traffic**:
   - Unencrypted data on port 443.
   - Server destinations using IP addresses instead of FQDN.
   - Absence of SSL/TLS handshake.

#### Monitoring

Tools like Wireshark can decrypt HTTPS traffic using private keys and identify suspicious activities like ransomware communication or anomalies in the SSL handshake.

[[Detailed Notes on HTTPS Traffic]]

---

### Unknown Traffic

- **Custom Protocols**: Uncommon protocols may appear on familiar ports (e.g., CrypMIC ransomware using port 443 for C2 communication).
- **AIM Example**: AOL Instant Messenger’s OSCAR protocol identified over port 443 via **Wireshark Decode As** feature.

#### Key Observations

- Traffic unencrypted, SSL fields empty.
- Proper dissectors (e.g., AIM) reveal protocol details.

---

#### Takeaway

Unknown traffic often mimics standard ports but requires deep analysis to uncover malicious behavior.
