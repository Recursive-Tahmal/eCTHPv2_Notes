# 3.3 Detection Techniques

## Overview
- Malware authors often reuse or modify existing malware to avoid detection.
- Detection techniques can help identify:
  - Reused malware within a defined malware family.
  - Malware execution and correlate actions around execution time.

---

## Techniques Covered
1. **Fuzzy Hashing**
2. **Import Hashing**
3. **Execution Tracing**

---

### **3.3.1 Fuzzy Hashing**
- **Definition**: Fuzzy hashing identifies similar files even if they are not identical.  
  - It breaks files into smaller chunks and generates hashes for each chunk.
  - This allows detection of similarities even with changes such as insertions, deletions, or modifications in the file.
- **How It Works**:
  - Matches files with similar byte sequences, even if the content or length of bytes in between differs.
  - Ideal for detecting slightly modified or repackaged malware.
- **Tool**: **SSDeep**
  - A common fuzzy hashing tool used to compute **context triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH)**.
  - Often utilized by VirusTotal to analyze uploaded files and identify similar malware samples.
- **Example**:  
  Think of it as a way to find documents with similar phrases, even if the rest of the text is different.

---

### **3.3.2 Import Hashing (Imphash)**
- **Definition**: A hashing technique that tracks the functions or APIs called by an executable.  
  - Creates a hash (imphash) based on the order and names of imported libraries/functions.  
- **How It Works**:
  - Malware executables often reuse similar import tables. By hashing this information, related malware can be grouped or tracked.
  - Useful for identifying new malware variants created by the same threat actor.
- **Example**:
  - Imagine two malware samples using the same set of imported functions in a similar order. Import hashing can flag these as related.
- **Benefits**:
  - Quickly correlate malware samples.
  - Efficiently track malware families.

---

### **3.3.3 Execution Tracing**
- **Definition**: Tracks programs executed on a system to analyze their behavior and identify potential malware.  
  - Relies on execution trace artifacts like ShimCache or AmCache metadata.
- **How It Works**:
  - ShimCache (Application Compatibility Cache) records metadata of executed programs, originally for compatibility tracking.
  - Tools parse this data to reconstruct execution history and detect suspicious behavior.
- **Tools**:
  1. **ShimCacheParser**:
     - Extracts ShimCache metadata for analysis.
  2. **AppCompatProcessor**:
     - A more advanced tool with features like:
       - **Temporal Execution Correlation**: Matches events based on time.
       - **Time Stacking**: Analyzes event timelines for anomalies.
- **Example**:  
  These tools can reconstruct what programs were executed, helping detect malware activity even after the executable is removed.

---

## Summary
- **Fuzzy Hashing**: Identifies similar files by chunking and comparing hashes, even with modifications.  
- **Import Hashing**: Tracks malware samples based on the sequence of imported functions.  
- **Execution Tracing**: Analyzes execution history using system metadata to uncover suspicious behavior.  
- Combining these techniques enhances malware detection and investigation.

# 3.4 Memory Analysis

**Overview**  
Traditional file-system detection techniques are unreliable for detecting **memory-resident malware.** Memory analysis allows analysts to identify malware, extract valuable runtime information, and understand malware capabilities, bypassing rootkit interference.

---

## Key Advantages of Memory Analysis

- **Unprecedented visibility** into the run-time state of a system.
- Detect **running processes, open network connections, and executed commands** independently of the OS.
- Recover **critical data** like:
    - Encryption keys
    - Injected code fragments

---

## Memory Injection Techniques

Malware often manipulates or injects code directly into memory. Common techniques include:

- **Shellcode Injection**
- **DLL Injection** and **Reflective DLL Injection**
- **Process Hollowing**
- **API Hooking**
- **Gargoyle**

---

## Acquiring Memory

Before analyzing, **memory acquisition** (or dumping) is required. It involves mapping physical memory to a file (**memory image**).

#### **Approaches to Memory Acquisition**

1. **Hardware Acquisition**
    
    - Communicates directly with the memory controller (bypassing OS).
    - Resistant to rootkit interference.
    - Requires a PCI card for acquisition.
2. **Software Acquisition**
    
    - Maps the `\Device\PhysicalMemory` object.
    - Requires kernel-mode access.
    - **Requirements for stable tools**:
        - OS support
        - Minimal memory footprint
        - Ability to capture reserved memory sections
        - Output file support

**Drawbacks of Software Acquisition**:

- Consumes process/kernel memory, potentially overwriting evidence.
- Vulnerable to rootkit modifications.

#### **Tools for Memory Acquisition**

- **Non-Commercial Tools**:
    - FTK Imager
    - DumpIt
    - MAGNET RAM Capture

#### **Memory Acquisition in Virtual Machines**

- VM vendors provide memory files when systems are:
    - **Suspended**
    - **Snapshot Taken** (e.g., `.vmem` in VMware).
- Debugging mode may be required in **VirtualBox**.
- Memory dumps can also come from:
    - System crash files
    - Hibernation files

## Analyzing Memory: Identifying Anomalies

### **Process Anomalies**

- **Image Name**: Legitimate and correctly spelled?
- **Full Path**: Appropriate system path?
- **Parent Process**: Is it expected?
- **Command Line**: Do the arguments make sense?
- **Start Time**: Was the process active at boot?
- **Security Identifier (SID)**: Does a system process use a user SID?

### **Network Activity Anomalies**

- Processes communicating on ports **80, 443, 8080** (web ports) but not browsers.
- Browsers not using web ports.
- Connections to:
    - **Unexplained IP addresses** (internal or external).
    - Direct IP requests instead of domain names.
- **RDP Connections** (Port 3389): Suspicious IP origins.
- DNS requests for **unusual domain names**.

### **Additional Anomalies**

- **Unlinked Processes**
- **Suspicious DLLs**
- **Unlinked Network Connections**
- **Unmapped Memory Pages** with execute privileges (e.g., injected code).
- **Hooked API Functions**
- Detection via **YARA signatures** and bad heuristics.
