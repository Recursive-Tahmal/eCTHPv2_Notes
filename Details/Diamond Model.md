### Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

The **Diamond Model** is a framework used to analyze and understand cyber intrusions by focusing on the relationships between four core components: **Adversary**, **Infrastructure**, **Victim**, and **Capability**.

---

1. **Adversary:**
    - **Definition:** The actor or group responsible for the intrusion.
    - **Purpose:** Understanding the adversaryâ€™s motivations, skills, and objectives provides insight into potential future actions.
2. **Infrastructure:**
    - **Definition:** The systems and resources the adversary uses to conduct their attack (e.g., servers, IP addresses, domains).
    - **Purpose:** Analyzing infrastructure helps identify patterns, locate additional threats, and disrupt operations.
3. **Victim:**
    - **Definition:** The targeted entity, such as an individual, organization, or system.
    - **Purpose:** Understanding the victim helps determine why they were targeted and identify other potential targets.
4. **Capability:**
    - **Definition:** The tools, techniques, and exploits used by the adversary to achieve their objectives.
    - **Purpose:** Identifying capabilities enables better defense, detection, and response strategies.

### Key Concepts
- **Relationships:** The model emphasizes connections between the components. For example, the adversary uses infrastructure and capabilities to target a victim.
- **Activity Threads:** By analyzing multiple events, analysts can link related intrusions and build a larger picture of adversary campaigns.
- **Pivoting:** Insight from one component can lead to discoveries in others, such as tracking infrastructure to uncover more adversary activity.
