Threat hunting is closely tied to the **Detection & Analysis Phase** of incident response because hunters can assist in confirming whether observed indicators represent an actual incident, while also identifying additional artifacts that may have been missed.

#### Key Connections:
1. **Incident Verification:**
    - Threat hunters help the incident response team determine if the observed indicators point to a real security incident.
    - **Example:** A threat hunter can analyze suspicious network traffic and identify whether it’s part of a broader attack, such as lateral movement or data exfiltration, helping to confirm if an incident has occurred.
2. **Artifact Discovery:**
    - Threat hunters may uncover additional artifacts or evidence overlooked during initial detection.
    - **Example:** While investigating a compromised endpoint, a threat hunter might discover hidden malware persistence mechanisms or system logs that weren’t initially flagged during automated detection, aiding in a more thorough analysis.
3. **Attacker Mindset:**
    - Threat hunters can apply their attacker mindset to look beyond obvious indicators, finding subtle clues that automated systems or less experienced analysts might miss.
    - **Example:** By thinking like an attacker, a hunter might identify small but significant anomalies in user behavior that signal an ongoing attack, which would be essential for fully understanding the scope of the incident.

In essence, the **Detection & Analysis Phase** benefits from threat hunters' expertise in validating incidents, finding overlooked evidence, and thinking like attackers to provide a deeper, more accurate analysis.
