Risk assessment involves:
1. **Threat Analysis:**
    - Identifying potential sources of harm to the organization, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, or human errors.
2. **Vulnerability Assessment:**
    - Evaluating weaknesses in systems, processes, or policies that could be exploited.
3. **Likelihood and Impact:**
    - Determining the probability of threats materializing and assessing their potential impact on business operations.
4. **Risk Prioritization:**
    - Listing and ranking vital systems or processes based on their importance and the consequences of compromise or failure.

The outcome is a **risk assessment report**, which provides an overview of critical assets, potential risks, and recommended mitigation strategies.
