Threat hunting is closely tied to the **Preparation Phase** of Incident Response because it requires clear, predefined rules and guidelines to operate effectively.

#### Key Connections:
1. **Rules of Engagement:**
    - Just like in the **Preparation Phase** of incident response, threat hunters need well-defined rules on how to operate. These rules ensure the team knows when, how, and under what circumstances they should act.
    - **Example:** A threat hunter knows they can only begin hunting during off-hours to avoid disrupting business operations, as defined in the **Preparation Phase**. If suspicious activity is detected, they must report it immediately to the incident response team following predefined steps.
2. **Predefined Terms:**
    - Threat hunters rely on established protocols for identifying and handling potential threats, which are part of the **Preparation Phase**.
    - **Example:** The **Preparation Phase** might define what constitutes a "compromise" (e.g., any unauthorized access to sensitive data) and outline the specific steps for investigating such events, including gathering logs and correlating with known attack tactics.
3. **Consistency in Response:**
    - By having clear procedures outlined in the preparation phase, both incident responders and threat hunters follow a consistent approach to handling incidents and minimizing risks.
    - **Example:** If a threat hunter uncovers a potential phishing attack, the **Preparation Phase** guidelines would dictate that they escalate the issue using the same process as incident responders, ensuring a uniform approach to containment and mitigation.

In essence, the **Preparation Phase** sets the groundwork, ensuring threat hunters have the tools, training, and protocols to act efficiently when a potential threat is detected.
