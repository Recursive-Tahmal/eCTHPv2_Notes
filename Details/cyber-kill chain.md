The Cyber-Kill Chain is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin to describe the stages of a cyberattack. It helps identify and mitigate threats at various stages. The seven stages are:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target.
2. **Weaponization**: Creating a malicious payload.
3. **Delivery**: Sending the payload to the target (e.g., via email or exploit).
4. **Exploitation**: Executing the payload to exploit vulnerabilities.
5. **Installation**: Installing malware on the target system.
6. **Command and Control (C2)**: Establishing communication with the attacker’s server.
7. **Actions on Objectives**: Achieving the attack’s goals, like data theft or disruption.

This model helps in identifying weaknesses and implementing defenses at each stage.
