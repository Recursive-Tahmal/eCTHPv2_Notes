In the **Post-Incident Activity Phase**, threat hunters may assist by analyzing the incident and identifying any gaps in detection or response procedures. Although they are typically not responsible for containment, eradication, or recovery tasks, some organizations may involve them in these activities based on their role and the specific incident response policies.

1. **Analysis and Recommendations:**
    - After an incident, hunters can provide insights on what was effective and suggest areas for improvement in both detection and defense strategies.
2. **Contribution to Post-Mortem:**
    - Hunters may offer valuable perspectives during the post-mortem analysis, helping to understand how the attack unfolded and areas where detection or response could have been enhanced.
3. **Policy Documentation:**
    - The specific roles and responsibilities of hunters, including whether they contribute to recovery or post-incident remediation, should be outlined in the organizationâ€™s **incident response policies and procedures**.

In essence, while hunters are not always directly involved in post-incident recovery, their insights are valuable for improving future response efforts and strengthening security measures.
